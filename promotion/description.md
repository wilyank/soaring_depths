# soaring_depths
a Minecraft modpack based around immersive tech and magic in a Skylands world.  


Progress through a broken world by machines and magic to construct a Nether Portal out of Crying Obsidian. Obtaining Nether materials will allow you to access smarter machines and more potent magic.
Craft an End Portal and explore the vast alien world of the End. Battle dangerous bosses and explore custom structures. Decide how you will improve the shattered overworld with your otherworldly powers of construction and destruction.

Magic and technology are intimately intertwined to provide an overarching exerperience. Indeed, Eidolon is now automatable!

This pack includes a ton of custom recipes, four origins, over a dozen custom structures, cool boss fights and much more.

There are four custom origins included in this pack, in addition to the default Human Origin:
- Zombie: Burns in sunlight, friendly with undead mobs.
- Kobold: Smaller, Faster, Stronger. Not accustomed to light, though.
- Piglin: Weaker in the Overworld, with a love of Gold and Netherite.
- Enderman: Tall, hydrophobic and can teleport around.


Mods:
The key mods in this pack are Create, Eidolon, Astral Sorcery, OTG: Skylands and Alex's Mobs.
